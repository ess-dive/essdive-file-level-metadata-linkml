# Slot: Southeast_Longitude_Coordinate


Southeast Longitude Coordinate for non-point location. This is part of a coordinate pair to form the Southeast corner of a bounding box for non-point locations. All geographic coordinates must be provided in WGS84 decimal format. It is strongly recommended to record the geographic coordinates in the FLMD in cases where the data file does not include geographic coordinates and the entire file consists of measurements collected at a single location. The FLMD Extractor can extract the geographic coordinates or bounding box coordinates from a CSV file following the CSV Reporting Format.
