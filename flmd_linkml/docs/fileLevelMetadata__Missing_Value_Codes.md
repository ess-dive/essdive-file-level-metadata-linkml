# Slot: Missing_Value_Codes


Report missing value codes. Report all Missing Value Codes. For columns containing numeric data, use "-9999" as the missing value code (or modify to match significant figures given the data). For columns containing character data, use "N/A" as the missing value code. If entering more than one missing value code, use a vertical bar "|" or semicolon ";" instead of a comma or protect the comma with matching double quotation marks around the entire value. For more information about commas not meant to be a delimiter (e.g. used within a cell), refer to the Delimiter section of the CSV Reporting Format Detailed Guide.
